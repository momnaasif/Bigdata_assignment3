Title: Data Preprocessing for Improved Analysis

Introduction:
This document outlines the preprocessing steps applied to the data file "data_115.json" for improved analysis. It provides an overview of the approach taken, rationale behind the chosen methodology, and the resulting output files.

Approach:

Data Sampling:
    • A sampling approach was employed to create a smaller subset of the original dataset based on a specified target size. This was achieved using the sample_json function.
    • The sampling process focused on records containing a specific key named "also_buy," ensuring that only relevant data was retained for further analysis.

Data Cleaning and Structuring:
    • Text fields within the dataset were cleaned to remove special characters and extra spaces. This was essential for maintaining consistency and improving the quality of textual data.
    • The clean_text function was utilized to perform text cleaning operations, ensuring that the text data was standardized and ready for analysis.

Preprocessing and Feature Extraction:
    • Each item in the dataset underwent preprocessing to extract relevant features such as "asin" (Amazon Standard Identification Number), "title," "features," "description," "brand," and "categories."
    • The preprocess_data function structured the data into a consistent format, facilitating ease of analysis and modeling tasks.

Batch Processing:
    • Batch processing techniques were implemented to efficiently handle large volumes of data. This helped in managing memory resources and processing the data in manageable chunks.
    • The process_batches function processed the data in batches, ensuring that the preprocessing pipeline was optimized for performance.


Why This Approach:

Efficiency:
The chosen approach prioritizes efficiency by sampling a smaller subset of the data, which reduces processing time and resource requirements.
Relevance:
By focusing on records containing the "also_buy" key, the preprocessing ensures that only relevant data is retained, enhancing the quality of the analysis.
Standardization:
Data cleaning and structuring operations ensure that the dataset is standardized and consistent, enabling seamless integration into analytical workflows.
Scalability:
Batch processing techniques make the preprocessing pipeline scalable, allowing it to handle large datasets effectively while maintaining optimal performance.

Output:
The output of the preprocessing pipeline is stored in the file "preprocessed_updated_5.json."
This file contains the cleaned and structured data ready for further analysis, modeling, or other downstream tasks.

Conclusion:
The preprocessing steps outlined in this document ensure that the data is cleansed, standardized, and optimized for analytical purposes. By employing efficient sampling, cleaning, and structuring techniques, the dataset is prepared for insightful analysis and meaningful interpretation.

Approach:

Kafka Producer Configuration:
    • The script initializes a Kafka producer object with configuration settings to connect to the Kafka broker.
    • Serialization is applied to the data using a JSON serializer to ensure compatibility with Kafka.
Data Preprocessing:
    • A preprocessing function (preprocess_data) is defined to extract relevant fields from the input data.
    • The function processes each data item, extracting fields such as "asin" and "title," which are essential for downstream analysis.
Data Streaming to Kafka:
    • The send_data_to_kafka function iterates through a generator that yields preprocessed data.
    • Each data item is sent to a specified Kafka topic ('product_info' in this case) using the Kafka producer.
    • Real-time streaming is simulated by introducing a delay between data sends, allowing for a controlled data flow.
Loading and Processing JSON Data:
    • The load_and_process_json function loads JSON data from a file and preprocesses each data item using the preprocess_data function.
    • It handles both JSON objects and JSON lines format for flexibility in data input.
Main Function Execution:
    • The main function executes the Kafka producer script by specifying the input JSON file and initiating the data streaming process.

Why This Approach:

Real-time Streaming Capability:
    • Kafka provides robust real-time data streaming capabilities, making it suitable for scenarios requiring low latency and high throughput.

Scalability:
    • Kafka's distributed architecture allows for horizontal scaling, enabling the handling of large volumes of data across multiple producers and consumers.

Fault Tolerance:
    • Kafka ensures data durability and fault tolerance by replicating data across multiple brokers, minimizing the risk of data loss.

Flexibility:
    • The script is designed to be flexible, supporting different JSON data formats and allowing for easy customization of preprocessing and streaming logic.

Usage Instructions:

    • Update the Kafka broker configuration (bootstrap_servers) if Kafka is hosted elsewhere.
